Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

### 5. Make your changes
- Follow the **project structure** (backend and frontend separation).
- Test your changes locally.
- For backend changes: ensure the Flask server runs without errors.
- For frontend changes: open `index.html` or run your local server to verify UI/UX.

### 6. Commit your changes
Write meaningful commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: brief description of your changes"
```

### 7. Keep your fork updated
Before pushing your branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

Resolve any conflicts if they appear.

### 8. Push and open a Pull Request
